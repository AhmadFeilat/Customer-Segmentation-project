## Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- I am building a system that segments customers into different groups based on their behavior and characteristics. For this use case
- I applied unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering.
- The process involved feature engineering, handling outliers, and using a heatmap to understand relationships between features.
- After scaling the data, I applied PCA for dimensionality reduction before performing clustering. 
- Finally, customer profiles were analyzed for each cluster to better understand distinct customer segments.
